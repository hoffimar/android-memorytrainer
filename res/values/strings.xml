	<!-- Help -->
	<string name="intro">This app is all about the loci method. This method
		helps you in e.g. memorizing large numbers by creating a story using
		images instead of the numbers itself.</string>
	<string name="first_steps">This is how the app works:\n
		1. Click
		on generate
		number and try to memorize it. You can press menu
		to
		specify the length
		of the number. To memorize it, break it down into
		pairs of digits, and
		associate each 2-digit number with some item,
		animal, ... (you can
		create a spreadsheet at google docs as described
		below so you can see
		which item belongs to the different numbers). You
		usually create a
		story or walkthrough which uses the numbers and items
		you set up.\n
		2.
		After you have memorized the numbers go back and go to
		type in last
		number. There, press verify to see if you were right.
		Each try will be
		recorded and save to your statistics.\n
		3. Press
		statistics to see how
		often you were right or wrong.\n
		4. Go to \'Maintain list\' to maintain
		the items for all 100 numbers. You can also go
		to docs.google.com and
		create a spreadsheet named \"MemoryTrainer\".
		There, in column \'A\'
		fill in an item, animal, or person that you can
		associate with the
		respective row number. E.g., use \'unicorn\' in row
		1. For row 5 you
		could use \'hand\'. Check out the developer\'s
		homepage to see an even
		lengthier description.

	<!-- Treelist -->
	<string name="treelist_intro_text">This is the treelist, covering all numbers from 1
		to 10. There is an item associated with each number, the reason is
		shown in brackets. Try to memorize each number and the item to its
		right.</string>
	<string name="treelist_intro_button_continue">Continue</string>
	<string name="treelist_item01">Unicorn (1 horn)</string>
	<string name="treelist_item02">Light switch (2 states)</string>

	<string name="treelist_verify_button">Verify</string>
	<string name="treelist_verify_dialog_positive">Well done! This is how the loci method basically
		works. You could now go back to the main screen and try with some
		larger numbers and a list of 100 items (read the help there if
		needed).</string>
	<string name="treelist_verify_dialog_negative">Your number doesn\'t match, try again.</string>
