- show hints (mapping to list items) for numbers -> in a nicer way
- error handling; working without gdocs list or no document
- features for new users: hardcoded list of 20 items to learn the technique
- ask the user if usage data can be collected via flurry

********************************************************
nice to have:
********************************************************
- let the user specify pictures (URLs?) for the different numbers
- make 100-list items editable, and uploadable to gdocs
- write test cases
- maintain statistics on how often the user was right -> more of 'em (& nicer)
	- how old were the numbers, how long were the numbers, ...
- fix that the number '100' will not be generated (3 digits)
- show where the user was wrong when typing in a number (more detailed: compare number by number)
- find icons and nicer buttons?

********************************************************
productization:
********************************************************
- set up a wiki page
- detailed description what the app does, e.g. with a link to some (international) books (help dialog?); how to maintain 100-list
- put app into the android market
- promote the app -> where?

********************************************************
future:
********************************************************
- are there some more use cases (training methods) from the book?
- exchange flurry against google analytics

********************************************************
regular tasks:
********************************************************
- localization of the texts
